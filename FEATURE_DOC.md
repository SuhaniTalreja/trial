# React Homepage Boilerplate

This document details a boilerplate React homepage implementation using CSS Modules and React Router v6.  It provides a basic structure for building upon, emphasizing clean organization and best practices.

## Purpose

This boilerplate provides a foundation for creating a simple, yet extensible, homepage in a React application. It includes routing, basic styling with CSS Modules, and a placeholder for content.  This allows developers to quickly set up a homepage and begin adding features without needing to start from scratch.

## How it Works

The boilerplate uses the following technologies and techniques:

* **React:** The core JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
* **React Router v6:**  Handles client-side routing, allowing navigation to different parts of the application.  In this case, it routes the root URL ("/") to the `Home` component.
* **CSS Modules:**  Localizes CSS styles to prevent naming conflicts.  Each component has its own CSS file (`Home.module.css`), ensuring style encapsulation.
* **Flexbox:**  Used for simple layout management within the `Home` component, centering content and making the layout responsive.


The application structure is designed for scalability:

1.  **`src/pages/Home.jsx`:** Contains the React component for the homepage.  This is where the majority of your homepage content will reside.
2.  **`src/pages/Home.module.css`:** Contains the CSS styles specific to the `Home` component.  This promotes maintainability and avoids CSS conflicts.
3.  **`src/App.jsx`:** The main application component that sets up the routing using `react-router-dom`.
4.  **`src/index.js`:** The entry point for the React application.


## Usage

1. **Project Setup:**
   - Create a new React project using Create React App: `npx create-react-app my-react-app` (or your preferred method like Vite).
   - Install `react-router-dom`: `npm install react-router-dom`

2. **Replace `src` folder:** Replace the contents of the `src` folder in your new project with the provided code.

3. **Run the application:** `npm start` (or the equivalent command for your project setup).  This will launch the development server and display the homepage in your browser.


## Code Breakdown

The code is structured as follows:

**`src/pages/Home.jsx`:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import styles from './Home.module.css';

const Home = () => {
  return (
    <div className={styles.container}>
      <h1>Welcome to my Home Page!</h1>
      <p>This is some boilerplate content.  Let's add some more!</p>
      <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/350x150" alt="Placeholder Image" />
    </div>
  );
};

export default Home;
```

This component renders a simple homepage with a heading, paragraph, and a placeholder image.  The `className={styles.container}` applies styles defined in `Home.module.css`.

**`src/pages/Home.module.css`:**

```css
.container {
  text-align: center;
  padding: 20px;
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
}

.container img {
  margin-top: 20px;
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

This CSS file contains styles for the `.container` class, centering the content and using Flexbox for layout. The image within the container is made responsive.


**`src/App.jsx`:**

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
import Home from './pages/Home';

function App() {
  return (
    <Router>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
      </Routes>
    </Router>
  );
}

export default App;
```

This component sets up the routing using React Router.  The `/` route renders the `Home` component.

**`src/index.js`:**

This file is a standard React entry point, rendering the `<App />` component.


## Extending the Boilerplate

This boilerplate is easily extensible. You can:

* **Add more content:**  Replace the placeholder content in `Home.jsx` with your actual homepage content.
* **Add more routes:** Add more `<Route>` components to `App.jsx` to navigate to other pages.
* **Implement more complex styling:** Add more CSS rules to `Home.module.css` or use a different styling solution (e.g., styled-components).
* **Integrate external libraries and APIs:**  Add functionality based on your project requirements.


This detailed documentation should allow developers to effectively use and expand upon this React homepage boilerplate.  Remember to replace the placeholder image URL with your own.
